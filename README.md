# Tree Tapper Server
Tiny server back end for the [Tree Tapper game](https://github.com/gereonelvers/tree-tapper). Written in [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/).
It does what it needs to, but but there is still major work left to be done in order to bring it up to par.  
**Still very much WIP!**

## Running the server
To run the server, execute the following in an environment where [Git](https://git-scm.com/), [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) are installed and available:
```
git clone https://github.com/gereonelvers/tree-tapper-server.git
cd tree-tapper-server
npm install
npm app.js
```

Afterwards the server will listen for request on Port 80.
